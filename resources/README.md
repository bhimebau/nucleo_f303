# Resources

This folder is for holding tests and data taken from the device.
Filename Convention is a follows:

	 <year>-<month>-<day>-TestName.txt

Any Screenlog.0 is part of an ongoing test, because screenlogs append every time you write to them. They should be converted to the above syntax once a different test is made.
